# Build it with Drupal 8
[Download Compiled Version on Leanpub](http://leanpub.com/drupal-8-book)  
  
Hey there, this is an Open Source book for aspiring site builders that want to get their hands dirty with some Drupal 8 construction. We've put the initial bulk of the text up for free and hope we can get people to contribute, maybe we can make this a free and definitive resource that is easy and free to disseminate. 

The code here gets pulled to Leanpub where it gets formatted to PDF, EPUB, and MOBI formats. Everyone is welcome to download it from there, it's free. If you pay, all the money is donated to the EFF.
