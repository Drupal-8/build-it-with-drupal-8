# Creating a Portfolio Website
You or someone you know has had to showcase your past work at some point. A portfolio website is created to showcase it in a clean and digestible manner, usually accompanied by contact information, in the end the goal is to gain additional work.  Let's jump into it.  

## Creating an Image Style
  
As a first step, let us define a style for the images that we are going to use in our Portfolio. Go over to *Configuration* and select *Image Styles* from the *Media* section. A page similar to this is displayed.  
  
![image style](images/image_style.jpg "Image Style")  
  
Now select the *Add Image Style* button and this takes you to the page shown below, in this page you can enter the identifying information for the style.  
  
![add image style](images/add_image_style.jpg "Add Image Style")  
  
Let's name our style *portfolio_image*. Once the name is specified, the machine name for this style is automatically generated for us. Once you enter the name, select the *Create new style* button. This should take you to the following page:  
  
![portfolio style](images/portfolio_style.jpg "Portfolio Style")   
  
Now we have to select an effect for this style from the dropdown list in the *Effect* section. In this case let us select the *Scale and crop* effect. This effect will take just about any image you throw at it and resize it as best as it can, and then crop the edges off so it conforms to the dimensions we specify, then it saves that that version of the image on the server. This helps the image look great at it's new size, load quickly, and saves us the computing power it takes to resize the image every time it loads.  Once selected, click the *Add* button. This takes you to the page which has the fields to define the Width and the Height of the image.  
  
![scaling and cropping](images/scale_crop.jpg "Scaling and Cropping")  
  
Now enter the value for the width (e.g., 250) and the height (e.g., 300) of the image in the respective fields. Once done, select the *Add effect* button and we have created our image style successfully. This should take you to the page as shown.  
  
![scaling](images/scale_crop.jpg "Scaling")  
  
Now select *Update Style* button. If you wish to apply a different style and want to remove this style, you can select the *Delete* link. Also note that you can add more than one image style to an image.  
  
## Creating the Portfolio Content Type
  
Now that we have created the style that we would like to apply to our portfolio image, let's move on to the next step – designing a content type. Go over to *Structure* and select *Content types*.  
  
![portfolio content type](images/portfolio_conten_type.jpg "Portfolio Content Type")  
  
Now select  the *Add content type* button as such.  
  
![add portfolio content type](images/add_portfolio_content_type.jpg "Add Portfolio Content Type")  
  
Now enter the name of the content type (e.g., showcase_content) that we are creating in the *Name* field. You can provide a description about the content type that you are creating in the *Description* field if you wish, this is to help you or people working with you to differentiate between all the different content types you may have in the end, which can be quite a bit. Next, select *Menu Settings* tab.
    
![menu settings](images/menu_settings.jpg "Menu Settings")  
  
In this page, ensure the “Main Navigation” checkbox is selected. Next, select the *Save and manage fields* button at the bottom of the page.    
  
![portfolio manage fields](images/portfolio_manage_fields.jpg "Portfolio Manage Fields")  
  
## Adding Fields
  
Now let's add the fields that will hold the images in our portfolio items. To do this, enter the name of the field (e.g., showcase_image) in the “Add new field” text box and select “Image” as the field type. This will change our field from a regular text field to an upload field made just for images, Drupal takes care of all the heavy lifting for us. Once done, hit the “Save” button.  
  
![portfolio field settings](images/portfolio_field_settings.jpg "Portfolio Field Settings")  
  
Now we get to choose the default settings for our image field, when we're done select the *Save field settings* button. This takes us to the next page which has more fields to make the default settings as shown.  
  
![portfolio extensions](images/portfolio_extensions.jpg "Portfolio Extensions")  
  
Now enter the required values and select “Save settings” button.  
  
![portfolio manage fields](images/portfolio_manage_fields_save.jpg "Portfolio Manage Fields")  

We've created our field, now we need to combine our image display rule with our newly created field. Go ahead and select the *Manage display* tab. On this tab we'll control how our fields are displayed to our visitors.  
  
![portfolio manage display](images/portfolio_manage_display.jpg "Portfolio Manage Display")  
  
Now move over to “Teaser” tab at the top of the page and ensure the field (showcase_image) is enabled. This puts our image rule into effect. We should be all set on this page and we're ready to move on, select the *Manage form display* tab.  
  
![portfolio manage form display](images/portfolio_manage_form_display.jpg "Portfolio Manage Form Display")  
  
## Creating our View

By now it should all start making sense, create your content type, decide what information you want it to have, and display it all in the end with Views. Mastering this workflow is key.

Make sure the field (showcase_image) we created in the Manage display tab is enabled. Now save the form. Let's create a view organize the content we want to display. You can refer to the Views section for more information on what views are and how to create one. Let's add a new view and call it *view_showcase* and configure a *Block* to display the view. Once the basic settings are defined, your page should look something like this  
  
![portfolio display settings](images/porfolio_display_settings.jpg "Portfolio Display Settings")  
  
In the Format section, set the format to *Grid*. You can do this by clicking on the existing format. We want our images to display nice and even to our visitors.  
  
![portfolio view](images/portfolio_view.jpg "Portfolio View")  
  
Select the *Grid* option and select *Apply* to select the format. Here you can choose how many images you want to display per row, as well as grouping options which we'll cover later on. You can preview the format in the preview section at the bottom of the page. To display the images, we need a add an image field. To do this, select the *Add* button in the Fields section.  
  
![portfolio add fields](images/portfolio_add_fields.jpg "Portfolio Add Fields")  
  
In the search field, enter the keyword *image* and select the required field from the search results. Next select *Add and configure fields*. Once done configure the image field and save it.  
  
Now that we have configured all the settings, let's add some content to our portfolio. Go over to Content and select *Add content* link and select the view that we created *showcase*. The following page is displayed.  
  
![portfolio content](images/portfolio_content.jpg "Portfolio Content")  
  
Enter the name of the file in the *Title* field and select the required file to attach. Next select *Save and publish*. Now add more files to create a portfolio.
