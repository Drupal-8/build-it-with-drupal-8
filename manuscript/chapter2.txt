# Understanding Drupal

Using Drupal is a lot like playing with Legos, it is simple enough to use without having any programming knowledge, yet powerful enough to compete with most frameworks out there. The building blocks that comprise Drupal have all been made, and tested extensively, all that is left to do is to have an idea, and put it together. I'm personally very fond of this, as I don't particularly like to reinvent the wheel very often, only sometimes.

Drupal operates with the understanding that most websites share many fundamental similarities. If you have a website with Static Pages, Blog Posts, Event Listings, and so on, they are permutations of the same fundamental concept, like an "entry" of sorts, which in Drupal is called a Node. This way it is up to you to decide how each Node Type gets entered, displayed, and processed by your users on the site.

## Content Types
Imagine you have a paper notebook in front of you, and you're writing down journal entries, every day you enter similar information, let's say you add a date, a title, and the entry itself. Every day you would repeat this process in the blank sheet of paper. With that same notebook you can enter a list of friends that show up to play cards once a week, then record the winners and the losers. A Content Type is in some ways analogous to this sheet of paper where you use them for a given purpose. A Content type let's collect any information you want, let's say you want have a classified ad content type, you would collect a name, some information, some pictures, perhaps even a price, a location, and a phone number. It only differs from other Content Types in it's **purpose**.  
  
A Content Type is referred to is a method in which you can enter many different types of information into the database and interact with it in many different ways, to serve many different needs. For example, you can take your classified content type, and then you can display this content to your users by location, or by category, in a list, a table, or even Email it to them, it's that simple! This will become more clear as we move forward, just hang tight.

## Views

A View is a listing of Content. For Example, if you have a Blog Content Type, you can create a View which displays the last 10 most recent Blogs. You can display it in a Table, a List, etc. All without writing any code. All you have to do is add a new View and walk through the configuration process. This helps your website be very dynamic, as you add new content, the features built with views will display the content in the way in which you configured. Perhaps the newest blog entries, organized by date, or maybe the one with the most comments, and so on.

## Users

Drupal comes with user functionality bundled in, allowing you to manage users. This means that if you want to turn your small blog into a large operation, you can create many users and grant different levels of access to your writers, turning a small blog into a professional publishing platform in a few minutes.

## Themes

A theme consists of a few files containing PHP, HTML, and CSS to render your site's overall look. You may find predesigned themes available at https://drupal.org/project/project_theme

## Modules

A bundle of software that extends Drupal functionality. Modules that are contained within a fresh installation of Drupal are known as 'Core Modules' and modules that are developed by a team or an individual that is released on drupal.org are known as 'Contributed Modules'.

Let's say you want to display your Classifieds in a Map, or your events in a Calendar. There are Contributed Modules on Drupal.org that make this much easier for you.

## Taxonomy
You may want to categorize your content, whatever the category may be, the Taxonomy module can help you there. Let's say you want to add a category to your Classifieds content, you can add a list of categories (e.g. Auto, Jobs, etc). And if you need to, you can add as many levels of subcategories as you want to (e.g. Auto > Honda, Ford, Toyota, etc). Then Honda can be broken down into Models. This is very helpful when you want to allow a user to browse your content, allowing them to  filter and search as they please.

Drupal contains a module known as 'Taxonomy' which gives you the power of defining your own vocabularies. Each vocabulary can contain 'Terms' which in then can be grouped and attributed to a content type, or multiple content types. And a Content Type can have as many vocabularies attached to it as you need (e.g. Category, State, Status, etc).

## Regions & Blocks

Your Drupal site is laid out in what is known as 'Regions'. This includes your header, main content area, footer and sidebars (Some themes may vary.) Blocks are "boxes" containing data either created by a module (e.g. 'Recent Comments' from the 'Comment' module.) or created by you (e.g. A block of static text welcoming a user). A block may be displayed anywhere that the site's layout allows. You can access the blocks area by navigating through Administration » Structure » Block Layout, there you can browse the modules you already have as well as create new ones.

## Paths

The part of a URL after your initial site address is known as a path. (e.g. http://yourwebsite.com/contact-us) Paths may be defined by the user at the bottom of a content's edit page under 'URL Path Settings.'

## Menus
A Menu is a collection of links to other parts of your website, as well as other websites. By default Drupal comes equipped with a few pre-made menus, 'Administration', 'Footer', 'Main navigation', 'Tools', and 'User account menu'. Custom menu's may also be created by clicking the '+ Add Menu' button at the top, from here you'll be able to supply the title of the menu item as well as the 'Path' it should be taken to upon click. You can access the menu area by navigating through Administration » Structure » Menus.


### Going Forward

These concepts are extremely simplified and are only here to familiarize you with the **most** important aspects of Drupal that we will cover in this book. As we walk through the steps of creating a site, you'll quickly start connecting these ideas together.
